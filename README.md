# Right Values 2.0
Right Values 2.0 is a revamped version of the now dead remake of Right Values. This intends to add ideological references, add more apt and accurate descriptions of the results, make better questions and more questions and is designed for people from a right leaning perspective. Changes will be implemented gradually.
