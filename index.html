<h2>What is RightValues?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-answer">Rightvalues is a quiz for the people on the right of the spectrum, based upon the <a href="https://leftvalues.github.io/">LeftValues</a> quiz that seeks to identify your position on the right-wing spectrum, as the alternative to LeftValues. If you are not a rightist, this quiz is obviously not suited for you, and you should look for the LeftValues instead. You will be presented with a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the values?</h2>
  <p>There are currently six axes, each of which has two opposing values. They are:</p>

  <p><b style="color:#0c5199;">Cultural Left</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#42c2f5;">Cultural Right</b> (Cultural)<br/>
        This is Liberal vs Conservative in other words. The Cultural Left is left-wing culturally, supporting things like LQBT and Abortion. The Cultural Right wants to preserve culture and usually do not support the legalization of weed or abortion.</p>

	<p><b style="color:#174f8a;">StateOwn</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#c7c406;">Market</b> (Economic)<br/>
        Those with a higher State-Own score wants the state to own more property, an example being Feudalism. Those who score higher on Market want a freer market and wants the individual to own their own property more.

	<p><b style="color:#070091;">Central</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#010733;">Decentral</b> (Civil)<br/>
        Those with a higher central score tend to support an economic structure based around centralized national planning. Those with a higher decentral score tend to support an economic structure based around decentralized planning, usually on a more localized scale, with a government with less power.</p>

	<p><b style="color:#90bcd6;">World</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#7F3300;">Nation</b> (Diplomatic)<br/>
        Those with a higher World score tend to support international ties and aliiances, often with the eventual goal of peace. Those with a higher national score tend to prioritize their nation within existing borders and reject relations, and often is patriotic.</p>

	<p><b style="color:#d48817;">Religious</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#d1ccae;">Secular</b> (Political Theism)<br/>
        Those with a higher Religious score support a somewhat theocratical government, or a government where religion is prominant. Those with a higher secular score tend to want a religion-less nation, with the extreme being a government abolishing religion. This scale is about how much religion takes place in a country <b>politically</b>.</p>

	<p><b style="color:#389cd1;">Economy</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#c4b631;">Nature</b> (Environmental)<br/>
        Those with a higher economy score value the economy and production more than the nature. They think that the priority of production and capital is higher than that of the nature. Those with a higher nature score tend to prioritize the nature, and think that the environment is more important.

	<p><b style="color:#27577A;">Race</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#C4A717;">Equality</b> (Societal)<br/>
        Those with a higher Race score think each race has different roles, strengths, and weaknesses. Those with a higher Equality score think race is not important, and we should see people at their character more than their race.</p>

<h2>What does "Closest Match" mean in the results?</h2>
    <p>Similar to 8values, this quiz will attempt to match you with a specific rightist ideology. There are currently 13 ideologies, with more to come. Suggestions are very welcome. </p>
<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-scores">Please remember that you are not intended to get a 100% score in any of the categories. The point of the quiz is to challenge your views. If you have any suggestions or constructive criticism please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/Puc4sjaSQqvwNu6q8">short form</a>.</p>

<h2>Official Release!</h2>
